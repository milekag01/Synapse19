							“I don’t do fashion, I am Fashion!” <em>– Coco Chanel </em><br>
							<br>
							Fashion is an art, a religion, a peek into a personality. For some, it’s an escape or a disguise while for others it’s just being comfortable. But ultimately, fashion is an individual statement of expression for each of us and RAMPAGE is the avenue to express yourself. A fashion show is a chance for a designer to show off a particular aesthetic, a particular mood, a particular feel or point of view. As a result, fashion shows can tend to be more conceptual and focused on a higher level idea where spectators enjoy the procession of cutting-edge ensembles.</p>
							<h3>Rules:</h3>
							<h2>Team Size:</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Designers:1-4</li>
								<li>Models: 8-14</li>
								<li>Choreographer: 1</li>
								<li>Makeup Artists: 1-4 (excluding the models)</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Prelims:</h2>
							<p>In case of time constraints and more registrations, there will be prelims for registered teams. Further details regarding this will be posted on synapse.daiict.ac.in</p>
							<h3>JUDGEMENT CRITERIA</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Designers: Theme Originality, Depiction of Theme, Designing, Use of Props and Accessories, Use of fabrics</li>
								<li>Models: Ramp walk, Stage Presence, Poise, Overall Appearance</li>

							<ul>
								<li>Main Round will be held on   February 2019. This would be between the short-listed teams from the Preliminary round.</li>
								<li>Time Limit: 12-15 min(empty stage to empty stage)</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>General Rules:</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>RAMPAGE is open only for college students
								</li>
								<li>There can be multiple teams from a single college.</li>
								<li>Crossover teams can be formed between students of different colleges, all having valid college ID cards for the current year.</li>
								<li>Teams are required to check the website frequently for any changes in the rules and regulations and specification of the arena of the event.</li>
								<li>The teams must bring their own music system for practice. The organizing team is not responsible for providing either space or music system for practice.
								</li>
								<li>Makeup and styling of the models are to be done by the teams themselves. We will only provide the team with dressing room.
								</li>
								<li>The pen drive should include details about the team name and college name.</li>
								<li>The team can ask for assistance from people outside the college such as choreographers, make-up artists, but these professionals will not be considered to be a part of the team.</li>
								<li>One member of the team should sit with sound technician or computer operator during the performance.</li>
								<li>
									We request to maintain the decorum of the event. The vulgarity of any kind would lead to disqualification of the team from the event. Hence, if the team feels that any stunt or costume design can be considered as vulgar, it is strongly advised to consult the organizers before performing it on stage. The decision of the organizers will be final in case of any disputes arising due to this.

                            <br>

                            Dance is a form of expression through which you can find yourself in that moment and lose

                            fusion, fasten your seatbelt, rock the stage and shake the world with your moves.

                            a jam-packed crowd in the OAT in the presence of the judges. Dance your way to victory.<br>
